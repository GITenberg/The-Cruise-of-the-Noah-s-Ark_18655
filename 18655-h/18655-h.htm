<h2>ALL ABOARD!</h2>
</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A stands for Animal, Ant or Ape,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Quite different in spelling as well as in shape.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" sighed Marjorie, "I'm tired of writing in this old copy
book. What's the use of making the letters just like the copy, anyhow?
Mother doesn't. Her capitals are very different."</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">B stands for Bruin, Bee or Bug&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The Bee has a sting and the Bear has a hug!</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" sighed Marjorie again, while she rested her head on her arm
and looked over at the Noah's Ark.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, something very strange happened. Mr. Noah
came out of his little Ark and said, "You had better come with us, for
it is going to rain for 40 days and 40 nights, and goodness knows where
this nursery will be by the end of that time; probably floating about,
half full of water, in the apple orchard."</p>

<p>"Do you really mean it?" asked Marjorie, gazing anxiously out of the
window at the rain which was falling in torrents.</p>

<p>"I certainly do," replied Mr. Noah.</p>

<p>And then Mrs. Noah poked her head out of a little window in the Ark.
"Listen to Mr. Noah, my dear, for he was certainly right the first time,
and why shouldn't he be now?"</p>

<p>Mr. Noah smiled and walked across the table towards a little yellow hen.
"Shoo,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> he cried, as the contrary fowl tried to dodge around a toy
automobile. "Shoo there. You know you can't swim like Mrs. Duck, so why
don't you have some sense and get aboard out of harm's way?"</p>

<p>As he finished speaking, water began to pour over the windowsill, and
soon the nursery floor was ankle deep. Marjorie stood on a chair and,
climbing upon the table, walked over to the Ark. On her way she picked
up her rag doll, Maria Jane, and the little toy automobile.</p>

<p>"Hurry, my dear," cried Mr. Noah, "here comes the water over the edge of
the table."</p>

<p>As it was, Maria Jane was splashed a bit, and so was the automobile
before it was pushed through the narrow doorway, for the Ark was rolling
from side to side in rather a dangerous manner.</p>

<p>"Make everything tight. Close the hatches and the portholes!" commanded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Capt. Noah (for now that they were actually afloat, this seemed the
proper title for him), and in a few minutes it was comfortable and snug
inside.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, a big wave carried them over the windowsill
and out into the garden. But it didn't look very much like the garden,
for only the tops of the rose bushes could be seen, and the roses rested
on the water like pond lilies. And then, away sailed the Ark, across the
garden, over the fence, down the road, until it reached an open space.</p>

<p>"The ocean!" cried Mrs. Noah.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" exclaimed Marjorie, "I beg your pardon, Mrs. Noah, I mean
it's Uncle Spencer's meadow. Why, there's Tim! Let's save him!" And
Marjorie ran down to the lower floor of the Ark and commenced to
unfasten the door.</p>

<p>"Careful, my dear," cried Capt. Noah. "What are you about?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, hurry, Captain," begged Marjorie, "Tim, Uncle Spencer's dog, is in
the water and I want to bring him aboard."</p>

<p>"Here, mates, bring me a life line," shouted Capt. Noah, and in less
time than I can take to tell it the line was thrown to the little dog,
who managed to catch hold of it with his teeth just in time, for the Ark
was going at a tremendous rate of speed.</p>

<p>"Don't haul in too fast," advised Capt. Noah, as his three sons began
pulling in the rope, "or he'll be drawn under the water and smothered
before we can get him aboard."</p>

<p>At last, the little dog was landed safely on the deck. Everybody ran
away from him to avoid getting a shower bath as he shook himself again
and again.</p>

<p>"Well, you've all proved to be brave lifesavers," said Mrs. Noah. "Now
I'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> give him some warm milk and dry him by the kitchen fire, or he may
get a severe cold. Goodness knows what would happen if he gave it to the
other animals and they all got to sneezing and coughing at the same
time."</p>

<p>And then the good woman took the little dog down into the hold of the
Ark, where the pantry and kitchen were, and he was soon fast asleep by
the stove, none the worse for his wetting.</p>

<p>It was now time for supper, so Mrs. Noah busied herself preparing the
evening meal, while Capt. Noah and his three sons, Ham, Shem and
Japheth, fed the animals. This was not an easy matter, for each animal
had a different taste, and the fodder had to be carefully measured so as
to give each one enough and no more.</p>

<p>The elephant ate almost a bale of hay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> for each meal, and the lion ate
about twenty large Delmonico steaks.</p>

<p>"It's lucky we haven't a whale on board," said Capt. Noah, as he rolled
a bale of hay up to Mrs. Elephant, at the same time warning Ham not to
give the lion a sirloin steak by mistake.</p>

<p>"You might feed the pigs, too," he added, wiping his forehead with a
red-bordered handkerchief. "They seem to like you, Ham. I guess they
consider you one of the family!"</p>

<p>Marjorie thought the rabbits were very pretty, but just as she was about
to play a game of hide and go seek with them, the supper bell rang, and
as soon as the three Noah boys had washed their hands and combed their
hair they came to the table. Shem pulled out his mother's chair and Ham
politely helped Marjorie into hers.</p>

<p>It was all very interesting to the little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> girl, and when Mrs. Noah
looked over at her and said, in a motherly way, "I always wanted a
little girl of my own," Marjorie felt quite at home.</p>

<p>"Thank you, ma'am," she said, "but I think you have very nice boys!"</p>

<p>After the supper table was cleared and the dishes washed, Mrs. Noah and
Marjorie went up on deck, where they found Capt. Noah contentedly
smoking his pipe. The three boys were having a merry time with the
little dog. The rain had stopped and the sky was full of stars.</p>

<p>"I don't know how much of a rainfall we have had this time," said Capt.
Noah, "but it must have been pretty heavy, for there seems to be as much
water around as there was when it rained for 40 days and 40 nights."</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, a harsh, grating noise was heard and
everybody jumped up. "Have we struck a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> rock?" inquired Mrs. Noah
anxiously.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Capt. Noah, peering over the side. "I can't see
bottom."</p>

<p>Suddenly the Ark stopped altogether.</p>

<p>"Guess we're aground now, all right," said Japheth. "It's too dark to
tell much about it, though."</p>

<p>"No, it isn't!" cried a deep, gurgling voice, and their astonished eyes
saw the head of a whale rise above the bow.</p>

<p>"I have a passenger for you," continued the whale. "He doesn't like his
present mode of travel, so I'm going to ship him over to you."</p>

<p>"How do you know we want him?" inquired Capt. Noah, going forward to
investigate. "We have a pretty full house as things are. And, besides,
he might be a Jonah."</p>

<p>"That's just who he is!" spouted the whale, with a gleeful gurgle, and
before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> any one could say "Jack Robinson!" Mr. Jonah appeared upon the
deck of the Ark, and with a swish of his great tail the whale
disappeared in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Sorry if I am intruding," said Mr. Jonah apologetically, "but the truth
is it was so dark and uncomfortable inside that whale that I would have
had nervous prostration had I been obliged to remain there another
minute."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Noah, slowly, looking Mr. Jonah over and seeing that
he wasn't such a bad looking person, after all, although a trifle damp,
"we'll see how we get along."</p>

<p>By this time Marjorie began to feel tired.</p>

<p>"Would you mind," she said, turning to Mrs. Noah, "if I went to bed? I
feel so sleepy, and it's long past Maria Jane's bedtime, I'm sure."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come right along with me," answered Mrs. Noah kindly.</p>

<p>"Good night, all," said Marjorie, following Mrs. Noah into the Ark.</p>

<p>"You shall sleep in the room next to mine," said Mrs. Noah, turning to
the little girl with a smile as she led the way into a pretty bedroom.
"Would you like me to unfasten your dress for you?"</p>

<p>"I think I can manage that," replied Marjorie, "but if you wouldn't
mind, I'd like to have you wait and tuck me in bed after I've said my
prayers. I can't very well tuck in the sheets at the side after I'm once
in."</p>

<p>So good, kind, motherly Mrs. Noah tucked in the little girl and kissed
her good night, and in a few minutes she was fast asleep, with her arms
tightly clasped around her rag doll, Maria Jane.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A rubber boot'll do."</span><br />
</p>


<p>Marjorie leaped out of bed and ran over to the window to see where the
Ark had drifted during the night.</p>

<p>To her surprise it was aground on the roof of a big barn.</p>

<p>And, goodness me! Didn't the weathercock look handsome, with his gilt
feathers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> shining brightly in the rays of the morning sun as he turned
to and fro with every little change of wind.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said Marjorie. "Isn't it a beautiful day?"</p>

<p>"I don't feel sure about anything," replied the weathercock. "I used to
be a jolly weathercock, but now, with all this water around, I feel more
like a lighthouse."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't you warn us off the reef&mdash;I mean the roof?" asked
Marjorie.</p>

<p>"I did, but everybody was asleep and paid no attention to me."</p>

<p>And just then the wind came in a sudden gust and the weathercock flew
around to face it.</p>

<p>"Goodness," he cried, "I believe it's going to rain again."</p>

<p>"Ahoy, there," shouted Capt. Noah from the deck below, "tell that gilt
rooster<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> I'm going to shove off. If he wants to come aboard he'd better
be quick about it."</p>

<p>"Would you like to come with us?" asked Marjorie. "I'd like to have you.
I once read about a very nice weathercock in 'Old Mother Goose.'"</p>

<p>"Thank you, I think I will," replied the weathercock, hopping nimbly on
to the flagpole of the Ark. "I shall feel more at home here now that the
green meadows have turned into an ocean. A barn is no place for a
rooster when the water is above the hayloft."</p>

<p>Marjorie had no time to answer, for just then the rain began to fall in
torrents, making it necessary to close the window.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the Ark began to quiver and shake, and then, with a
loud grating noise it slipped off the ridge of the roof and once more
floated down the tide.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Good-by, red barn, with your loft of hay,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We're off on a voyage to Far Away,"</span><br />
</p>

<p>crowed the weathercock. And then Marjorie waved her hand from behind the
window pane and ran down to breakfast where in a few minutes the family
were all seated around the table.</p>

<p>"What did you give the pigs for supper last night?" asked Capt. Noah,
looking at Ham suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Why, father?" asked Ham, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Because they don't seem well this morning."</p>

<p>"I gave them some green apples," said Ham.</p>

<p>"W-e-l-l," replied Capt. Noah, "don't know as that should make them
ill?"</p>

<p>"I chased them 'round the deck."</p>

<p>"What in thunder did you do that for?" asked his father.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wanted to see them slide when they turned the corners," said Ham,
sheepishly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they were seasick," interposed Mrs. Noah, who began to feel
sorry for Ham.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they weren't," said Capt. Noah, sternly. "I think, young man,
you had better be locked up in the brig for the rest of the day and fed
on bread and water. We can't afford to have any passengers abused by the
crew," and then he turned to Marjorie and smiled, "even if one of the
crew happens to be the captain's son."</p>

<p>And after that, poor Ham was solemnly marched up to the brig and locked
in, much to Marjorie's regret, for she liked Ham very much, although he
was the most mischievous of all Capt. Noah's sons.</p>

<p>It was still raining heavily, and as the wind was blowing quite a gale
the sea became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> rough and the Ark began to roll from side to side.</p>

<p>Pretty soon the animals grew uneasy, and strange noises came from many
parts of the boat.</p>

<p>The roar of the tiger mingled with the trumpeting of the elephant and
the howling of the wolf made a dreadful discord with the bellowing of
the buffalo.</p>

<p>Then the monkeys started to chatter, and the parrots to screech, the
horses to neigh and the pigs to squeak, the cows to moo and the donkeys
to bray, the wild hyena to laugh and the little lambs to bleat.</p>

<p>But luckily toward evening the storm went down, and if it had not I
guess Mrs. Noah would have gone crazy.</p>

<p>The dove, which was the most quiet and peaceful of all the passengers,
perched herself on Marjorie's shoulder.</p>

<p>"You shall sleep in my cabin," said the little girl, stroking its glossy
neck. "I'm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> sure you'd never get a wink of sleep if you had to stay
below decks to-night."</p>

<p>Toward evening the weather grew calm, and after supper the rain having
stopped, Marjorie went on deck for some fresh air. The weathercock, on
seeing the dove perched on the little girl's shoulder, called out
politely, "Good evening, ladies."</p>

<p>"Aren't you glad it cleared off?" asked Marjorie, looking up with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Indeed I am," he replied, swinging around on one toe like a dancer.</p>

<p>"Isn't he graceful?" cooed the dove in Marjorie's ear.</p>

<p>"S-s-sh!" she answered. "Don't let him hear you. He might get
conceited."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about down there?" asked the weathercock.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing in particular," answered the dove. "I was just receiving a
little advice from Marjorie."</p>

<p>"Well, you probably won't use it," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> the weathercock. "So you might
just as well hand it over to me."</p>

<p>"My, how curious you are!" laughed Marjorie.</p>

<p>"You'd be, too," answered the weathercock, "if you were in the habit of
having the winds tell you each day what was going on. It's not so much
curiosity as habit."</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Noah called: "Marjorie, I think you'd better come in.
It's too damp outside, my dear."</p>

<p>The cabin looked very cozy. Mrs. Noah was seated by the table knitting a
pair of socks for the captain, and the three boys were writing in their
copy books.</p>

<p>"I think, my dear," said Mrs. Noah, kindly, "it would be a good thing
for you to do a little studying each day." So Marjorie seated herself at
the table and Mrs. Noah opened a writing book and laid it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> before her.
With a cry of surprise Marjorie turned to Mrs. Noah:</p>

<p>"Why, it's the very copy book I have at home!"</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">"'A stands for Animal, Ant or Ape,</span><br/>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Quite different in spelling as well as in shape.'"</span></p>


<p>"The very same," cried Marjorie again.</p>

<p>"See how well you can make the capital letters," suggested Mrs. Noah.
"If you fill in this book nicely you can take it home with you and show
your mother how well you employed your time aboard the Ark."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you," cried Marjorie. "That will be lovely. Mother is always
worrying about my handwriting. I shall try my best to improve."</p>

<p>Mrs. Noah then turned to look in Ham's book.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is not a very good 'C' you have just made," she said.</p>

<p>"Well, you see," answered Ham, with a laugh, "the sea is so rough that
it made my 'C' rough, too."</p>

<p>Everybody laughed at Ham's witty excuse.</p>

<p>"What's all this levity about?" asked Capt. Noah, entering the cabin.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Coo!" said the little dove,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Coo!" said she,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"And they all lived together</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">In the big green tree."</span><br />
</p>

<p>"Hello!" exclaimed Capt. Noah, forgetting his own question, "the dove
spouting poetry, eh? Well, we'll have to give an entertainment. There
must be lots of talent on board. Plenty of material for a circus,
anyhow."</p>

<p>"How jolly!" exclaimed Marjorie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> "I'll make a ring to-morrow," said
Japheth.</p>

<p>"I've already trained one of the little pigs to walk on its hind legs,"
said Ham. "It's the white one with the pink nose."</p>

<p>"The elephant and I are great friends," added Shem. "I think he'd do
anything I asked him. Tonight when I rolled up his bale of hay, he
said, 'Hey, young man, look out for my toes!' And then he stood up on
top of the bale on his hind legs just as they do in the circus. I'll bet
I could make him do a lot of stunts."</p>

<p>"Just you wait until you see my wrestling monkeys," cried Ham. "I've
taught two of them already. They'll be better than a moving picture
show."</p>

<p>"My goodness, I think you have very clever boys," said Marjorie, who was
tickled to death to think they were going to have a circus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Noah did not reply at once. I guess she was thinking it over.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps they are," she said by and by. "I never thought of it in
just that way. I'm afraid I've always thought them mischievous."</p>

<p>"What time shall we have the circus?" asked Ham.</p>

<p>"Not too soon after breakfast," said Capt. Noah. "I don't want any sick
animals aboard."</p>

<p>"We'll be careful," said Japheth. "Let's go to bed now so as to wake up
bright and early to-morrow."</p>

<h2>THE CIRCUS</h2>
</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The ark goes sailing down the bay</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Upon the rushing tide;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the circus will commence to-day</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">With the animals safe inside.</span><br />
</p>

<p>This is the song the weathercock sang early the next morning.</p>

<p>Marjorie rubbed her eyes, and then jumped out of bed and looked out of
the window.</p>

<p>"Good morning," she said to the merry gilt rooster, "it's a fine day for
the circus. That was a pretty verse you just sang. Did you make it up?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said the weathercock proudly. "Just couldn't help it, you
know. The circus doesn't come to town every day in the week."</p>

<p>Well, after that, Marjorie hurried down to the breakfast table, where
she found Mr. Jonah seated with the rest of the family.</p>

<p>She had forgotten all about him, and so had I and maybe you have too,
for you see, Mr. Jonah hadn't been feeling very well and had remained in
his cabin since the day he'd left the whale.</p>

<p>"It's certainly a relief to be once more at a breakfast table," he said.
"Traveling inside a whale is like sailing in a submarine. Although a
whale is supposed to be neutral, nevertheless, I was frightened to death
for fear we might be torpedoed!"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," sighed Mrs. Noah, "these awful times one isn't safe
anywhere."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's right," exclaimed Capt. Noah, "we must keep a sharp lookout.
There's no telling how soon we may be in the war zone, and I am
responsible for the safety of all my passengers!"</p>

<p>And just then the Weathercock shouted something which sounded very much
like "Periscope!"</p>

<p>Well, you can imagine how excited everybody was after that.</p>

<p>"Where away?" asked Capt. Noah.</p>

<p>"Dead ahead," screamed the Weathercock.</p>

<p>Instantly all eyes were turned in that direction.</p>

<p>Some distance ahead stretched a long, smooth, sandy beach, on which was
a huge billboard with the words "Perry's Slope."</p>

<p>"Bah!" exclaimed Capt. Noah, "Perry's Slope isn't 'Periscope.' Well, I'm
glad it isn't."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are we going ashore?" asked Mr. Jonah.</p>

<p>"Looks like it," answered Capt. Noah; "the ark is pointed for the beach.
Hope we don't bump too hard. Some of the animals might get hurt."</p>

<p>The Ark was going at a fast clip, and as they neared the shore every one
clung tightly to the railing.</p>

<p>"Hold fast," shouted the Weathercock, as the bow touched the beach.</p>

<p>In another minute the Ark skimmed gracefully over the sand with as much
ease as it had sailed upon the ocean.</p>

<p>"Wonderful boat you have," exclaimed Mr. Jonah, looking at Capt. Noah.
"Ought to be proud of her. She's a dandy."</p>

<p>Before the latter had time to reply the Ark stopped, and everyone rushed
toward the gang-plank. "Let it down easily," commanded Capt. Noah,
"easy, there!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, the Ark's on wheels," cried Marjorie, as she stepped on the sandy
beach, "regular automobile wheels."</p>

<p>"Well, I declare," exclaimed Mrs. Noah, "so it is."</p>

<p>"Let's call it the 'Arkmobile,'" suggested Ham.</p>

<p>"Just the thing," said Shem, "don't you think so, father?"</p>

<p>Capt. Noah did not reply for a moment, for he was busily engaged
inspecting the bottom of the Ark.</p>

<p>"I was looking to see if it were built to run on the land," he replied,
"or whether it just went this far on account of its momentum."</p>

<p>"What's that noise?" asked Japheth.</p>

<p>"Sounds like the engine of an automobile," answered Shem.</p>

<p>"It's coming from the Ark," cried Ham.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>Capt. Noah hurriedly went below.</p>

<p>Presently he returned, smiling with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"There's a regular automobile engine in the hold, way aft," he said.
"And it's connected with a shaft, so that it will turn the wheels. We'll
have no difficulty in traveling on land."</p>

<p>"Hurrah for the Arkmobile!" shouted Ham.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"On land or on sea,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Wherever we be,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The Arkmobile</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Is the thing for me,"</span><br />
</p>

<p>sang Marjorie, skipping about on the sand.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Over sand, over foam,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Wherever we roam,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The Arkmobile</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Will carry us home,"</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>sang the Weathercock, and then he said: "I guess I'll come down from the
flagpole if you're going to camp here. If you're not, I'll stay where I
am, for it's a pretty good climb, and I'm not much of a sailor as yet."</p>

<p>"Let's stay here and have the circus," said Ham. "We can make a splendid
ring in the sand&mdash;in fact, we can have three rings if we want to. All we
have to do, you know, is to throw up the sand in a circle."</p>

<p>Every one agreed that it was an ideal spot, so the boys set to work at
once.</p>

<p>Mrs. Noah made Marjorie a wonderful dress, covered with gold spangles.</p>

<p>"I'm going to ride the big white horse just like a circus rider," cried
Marjorie. "And I shall stand up on the saddle and jump through my hoop.
Ham can hold it."</p>

<p>"Of course I will," he cried, looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> up from his work. "And I'll be
jolly glad when this ring is finished. I had no idea it would take so
long."</p>

<p>"Hurrah! Mine's finished," cried Japheth.</p>

<p>"And so's mine," shouted Shem.</p>

<p>"Well, I think mine's the biggest of all," said Ham. "It must be, or I'd
have finished when you fellows did."</p>

<p>"Father ought to put on his dress suit," said Shem, "and snap the whip
when Marjorie rides around the ring. You know just the way they do in
the real circus."</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" exclaimed Capt. Noah, overhearing the remark as he
descended the gang-plank. "I didn't bargain for this. But I suppose I
might as well put it on," and he turned back into the Ark.</p>

<p>The sound of hammering at that moment reached them. "What's going on?"
asked Ham.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let's see," suggested Shem, but before they reached the gang-plank Mr.
Jonah appeared. On his legs were strapped a pair of stilts, which made
him at least eight feet high.</p>

<p>"I'm going to be the giant," he said with a laugh, bumping down the
gang-plank in a clumsy manner. "I say, Mrs. Noah, could you sew the legs
of an old pair of trousers on to mine, so the stilts won't show?"</p>

<p>"Of course I can," replied Mrs. Noah, bursting into laughter. "But I'm
afraid they won't match."</p>

<p>In due course of time Marjorie's circus dress was finished and the
giant's trousers lengthened, the upper part being blue and the lower
part gray, but perfectly satisfactory to the wearer.</p>

<p>Every one was now waiting impatiently for Capt. Noah when, suddenly, his
head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> appeared at one of the port holes. "Mother," he called, "where are
my white dress ties? I can't find them anywhere."</p>

<p>So Mrs. Noah laid down her work basket and went into the Ark to find
them. And in a few minutes Capt. Noah appeared in full dress, his silk
hat upon his head and a long whip in his hand.</p>

<p>As he came down the plank, Japheth led out the big white horse, and
after helping Marjorie to mount, led him into the center ring.</p>

<p>Shem then opened the big door in the Ark and all the animals solemnly
marched out and arranged themselves about the rings.</p>

<p>Next came Ham, leading his two wrestling monkeys and after him came Shem
with his elephant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>Mr. Jonah, towering above the heads of the tallest animals, including
the giraffe, announced that the circus would commence.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he began, "allow me to introduce to you the most
wonderful child rider in the world, Marjorie Hall, on her beautiful
white horse, Marshmallow. Marjorie, without doubt, is the most daring
bareback rider in the universe."</p>

<p>There was a great clapping of hands, hoofs and paws at this
announcement, for she had become a great favorite with the Noah's Ark
people.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," went on Mr. Noah, "you see before you in Ring
No. 2 the most famous wrestlers of the world, Jocko and Monko. In Ring
No. 3 is the largest elephant in existence."</p>

<p>While all this was going on the Noah boys had run into the Ark.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently they returned, dressed up as clowns, and then the fun
commenced.</p>

<p>Ham held up a hoop, which he had carefully covered with tissue paper,
and to Mrs. Noah's amazement Marjorie leaped through it as if she had
been a circus bareback rider all her life.</p>

<p>The boys performed marvelous feats of tumbling and jumping, and were so
funny that half of the animals nearly split their sides with laughing.</p>

<p>The laughing hyena had to be carried into the Ark and put to bed for
fear she would laugh herself to death.</p>

<p>"Well, well," exclaimed Mrs. Noah, when it was all over, "I certainly
never enjoyed the circus so much in all my life, not even when I was a
little girl."</p>

<p>And that night every one slept like a top, let me tell you, for each one
was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> tired out with the day's work. Even the weathercock, I think,
tucked his head under his gilt wings and snored!</p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Wake up! Wake up! We're off again,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Over hill and over plain!</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Can sail away at our command."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Again the Weathercock awoke little Marjorie, on board the Noah's Ark,
where we left her in the last chapter, you remember.</p>

<p>It was the morning after the circus, and she probably would have slept
much later had not the faithful bird, as usual, sung his bit of verse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>You see this wonderful Weathercock was just like an alarm clock.</p>

<p>"Where's the ocean?" asked Marjorie, looking out of the window. "Why,
we're traveling on land!"</p>

<p>"Of course we are," answered the Weathercock. "Didn't you see the wheels
on the bottom of the Ark yesterday?"</p>

<p>"So I did," admitted Marjorie. "I'd forgotten all about them."</p>

<p>"Well, how did you like my poetry? You see, I make up a new verse every
morning, so as to be sure to wake you up."</p>

<p>"I think you are a great poet," answered the little girl.</p>

<p>The Weathercock got very red in the gills. I guess that's the only way
he could blush.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So let the rain or sunshine come,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Across the land, we'll swiftly hum,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We are prepared for rain or shine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For dusty road or foamy brine.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hurrah!" shouted the Elephant from down below. "Bravo, Sir
Chanticleer!"</p>

<p>"You'll have to excuse me now," said Marjorie to the Weathercock, "for I
must pull on my shoes and stockings and brush my hair. You don't have to
bother about such things, you know. That's one advantage of being a
weathercock."</p>

<p>After breakfast, as they all sat in the cabin, Capt. Noah remarked: "I'm
getting a trifle worried. You see, I can't tell by the barometer whether
the Ark is floating or wheeling. Now, that is rather important. If we
keep on in this way I shall have to get a speedometer. It wouldn't be
very nice to be arrested for breaking the speed laws and be locked up in
jail."</p>

<p>Mrs. Noah turned pale and the Weathercock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> shifted about uneasily on the
top of the flagpole. "No, indeed," he said, "I don't want to be a
jailbird."</p>

<p>"Well, what's the best thing to do?" asked Mrs. Noah.</p>

<p>"Count the telegraph poles as we go along," suggested Ham. "I think
there are about thirty to a mile, and see how long it takes to pass
them."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea," said Mr. Jonah, but when they looked out of the
portholes they couldn't find any telegraph poles.</p>

<p>And just then, all of a sudden, a pistol shot rang out clear and loud.</p>

<p>The Arkmobile came to a sudden stop, and a voice outside was heard to
exclaim:</p>

<p>"Where's the chauffeur?"</p>

<p>Capt. Noah rushed up on deck, followed by his family, Mr. Jonah and
Marjorie.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Capt. Noah, looking about to find the owner
of the voice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, that's what they all say!" came the reply. "You know jolly well
what's the matter!"</p>

<p>"Who are you, and where are you?" asked Capt. Noah, vainly trying to
find this remarkable person, who seemed to be nothing but a voice.</p>

<p>"Who am I? You'll find out pretty quick. Where am I? You'd better find
that out even quicker!"</p>

<p>Looking up to the Weathercock, Capt. Noah shouted: "Ahoy, there,
Lookout! Who's delaying us?"</p>

<p>"The Majesty of the Law," came the answering voice again&mdash;this time so
distinctly that every one turned in the direction from which it came,
and then a huge megaphone on the top of a post repeated: "The Majesty of
the Law!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be blowed!" exclaimed Capt. Noah.</p>

<p>"You have exceeded the speed limit,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> said the Megaphone, "and you are
fined $15!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" interposed Mrs. Noah. "I'm sure you must be mistaken. I'm sure we
were not exceeding it $15 worth."</p>

<p>"So am I!" added Mr. Jonah. "In fact, I didn't think we were exceeding
anything. We were just rolling along, don't you know, quite
comfortably."</p>

<p>"Well, suppose I haven't the money with me?" asked Capt. Noah.</p>

<p>"Fifteen days in jail," answered the Megaphone.</p>

<p>"Mercy!" cried Mrs. Noah.</p>

<p>"Don't worry," whispered Capt. Noah. "I'll borrow the money from Mr.
Jonah."</p>

<p>Mr. Jonah was very obliging and lent the money, saying he had had no
chance to spend a cent while he was aboard the whale.</p>

<p>"Now, where shall I put the money?" asked Capt. Noah.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the little box back of me," replied the Megaphone. And as soon as
the money was dropped in the Megaphone shouted: "The prisoner is
discharged!"</p>

<p>"Prisoner!" shouted Capt. Noah, as mad as a hornet. "How dare you call
me a prisoner!"</p>

<p>But before he had time to say another word the Arkmobile started off and
the Megaphone was left behind.</p>

<p>"Jehosaphat!" exclaimed Capt. Noah, wiping the perspiration from his
forehead with his red bordered handkerchief. "Bad enough to be robbed of
$15, but to be called a 'prisoner'&mdash;well, that does make me angry."</p>

<p>"Never mind, my dear," said Mrs. Noah, soothingly. "All's well that ends
well. Just think, if we hadn't been able to borrow that $15, we'd have
spent fifteen days in jail!"</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden the Weathercock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> shouted: "Everybody in the
cabin! Water dead ahead!"</p>

<p>My goodness me! you should have seen the animals pull their heads in
through the portholes. Poor Mrs. Giraffe didn't get hers inside in time
and her bonnet got soaking wet, for as soon as the Ark struck the water
the spray flew here and there and everywhere and the deck was flooded
ankle deep.</p>

<p>But the Ark was a sturdy craft, and as soon as it once more felt the
ocean beneath it, rode the waves as gracefully as a swan.</p>

<p>"I guess we won't be fined for speeding now," laughed Marjorie, and in
the next chapter you shall hear what further adventures she had aboard

<h2>MAN OVERBOARD</h2>
</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Wake up! Wake up! and sing your song</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As we roll merrily along.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Above the meadow sings the lark,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So let us sing aboard the Ark.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"There goes the Weathercock," cooed the Dove, flying over to the
porthole and looking out over the bright blue ocean.</p>

<p>"Tell him I'll get up in a minute," yawned Marjorie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>So the Dove, who slept in Marjorie's cabin in a pretty gilt cage, spoke
to the Weathercock, after which she commenced to sing:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">There's a robin in the woodland,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">There's a robin in the sea,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But they are just as different</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">As different can be.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The one that's in the forest</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Has feathers and a tail;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The one that's in the ocean</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Has a scaly coat of mail.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The robin in the forest</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Could never take a swim;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The robin of the ocean</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Could never fly or skim</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Across a grassy meadow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Nor fly up in a tree.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But he can do all kinds of stunts</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Within the deep blue sea.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where did you learn all that?" asked Marjorie, pulling on her
stockings.</p>

<p>"Listen; there's another verse and maybe two or three," cooed the Dove,
and then she began to sing again:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The robin of the woodland</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Has a pretty crimson vest;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He sings a merry, blithesome song</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And builds a cozy nest.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The robin of the ocean</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Has fins that look like wings.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He doesn't build a nest at all,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">He grunts, but never sings.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yet both of them are robins,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">As some of us have heard&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Although the ocean one's a fish,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The woodland one's a bird.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"Cock-a-doodle-do!" crowed the Weathercock, as the Dove finished her
song.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hurrah for you! You are the poet of the Ark."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" replied the modest little Dove. "That is not my own. My mother
taught me that song when I was a Dovelet."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" said the Weathercock, and he gave a sigh of relief, for I
guess he wanted to be the only poet on board the Ark and sing his little
songs every morning just as he had always done.</p>

<p>By this time Marjorie was dressed and, taking the Dove on her shoulder,
went down to the diningroom. As usual, the Noah boys were on hand with
great and glorious appetites.</p>

<p>"How are the animals this morning?" inquired Capt. Noah, helping himself
to a big saucer of oatmeal.</p>

<p>"Pretty well," answered Japheth.</p>

<p>"Some of the insects are getting restless," said Ham.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should say so," exclaimed Mrs. Noah. "Here's that big red Ant in the
sugar bowl."</p>

<p>"Catch him," cried Shem, "we ought to put him back where he belongs."'</p>

<p>But the Ant all of a sudden crawled out of the sugar bowl and ran down
the leg of the table and out on deck.</p>

<p>"There he goes!" shouted Marjorie.</p>

<p>"Quick, or he'll get away!" cried Capt. Noah. "I can't afford to lose a
single passenger!" Instantly the boys darted after the fleeing insect,
but just as they were about to snatch him up from the deck a wave washed
him overboard.</p>

<p>"Man overboard!" shouted the Weathercock.</p>

<p>And, my goodness! What a commotion there was after that! All the animals
rushed up on deck to see who had fallen into the ocean.</p>

<p>"Throw him a life-preserver!" yelled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> Mr. Jonah, and in a second Ham
unfastened a large "horsecollar" life-preserver and tossed it into the
ocean.</p>

<p>"Suppose he can't reach it," said the elephant. "I guess I'd better jump
in and save him," and overboard went the big animal with a loud splash.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" asked the Elephant, after looking around in vain for the
Ant. "I can't see him!"</p>

<p>And no wonder, for the sea was rough, and it was no easy matter to find
so small a passenger.</p>

<p>"Get my telescope!" yelled Capt. Noah.</p>

<p>"I think it's in my workbasket," said Mrs. Noah to Ham, who started at
once to obey his father's command. "If it isn't it may be in your
toolchest. I think you had it the other day when you were going to make
an anti-aircraft gun out of it for your toy army."</p>

<p>"That's where I found it," said Ham,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> a minute later, appearing
breathless with the telescope.</p>

<p>"Where abouts?" screamed the Elephant, who was now some distance from
the Ark.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, can't you?" yelled Capt. Noah. "I've got to adjust the
thing. These boys have been meddling with it!"</p>

<p>When this was finally done, Capt. Noah swept the sea with his glass, but
in vain; the form of the poor Ant was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>"Shiver my timbers!" said Capt. Noah, under his breath. "What will
happen to me if I lose a passenger?"</p>

<p>"Hurry up!" gasped the Elephant, now thoroughly worn out by the
buffeting of the waves. "Hurry up, I'm most in."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll have to get you out, then," answered Capt. Noah.</p>

<p>"Swim around to the port side," said Ham; "we'll hoist you up by the
davits."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hate to give up looking for the Ant," said the Elephant, as he
slipped the ropes under his big body.</p>

<p>And then, after much tugging and hauling away on the ropes he was lifted
up even with the deck. But beyond this it was impossible to do anything.
The davits refused to swing in, being hindered by the immense size of
the animal.</p>

<p>"Put your trunk on the deck," suggested Mr. Jonah. "That will make you
weigh less, and perhaps we can roll you over the edge."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's a good idea," said Shem. "Put your baggage aboard first."</p>

<p>"This is no time for joking&mdash;&mdash;We have lost one passenger and are in
danger of losing another. It will look very strange to lose the largest
and the smallest on the same day," said poor Capt. Noah, despairingly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<span class='caption'>MR. ELEPHANT HAS TROUBLE GETTING ABOARD</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>Well, just then, Mrs. Elephant came up from the hold. She had overslept
herself, and had only now heard the commotion on deck. On seeing her
mate swinging from the davits she set up a loud trumpeting.</p>

<p>"Goodness, gracious, Ella!" said the Elephant. "Don't carry on like
that. Screaming won't get me out. Get hold of me and help pull."</p>

<p>This was good advice, and pretty soon Mr. Elephant was landed safely on
board the Ark.</p>

<p>Just then the Weathercock called out that he could see the little red
Ant on the life-preserver.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness!" exclaimed Capt. Noah, and the Ark was turned in the
direction pointed out by the faithful lookout. Then Mr. Jonah leaned
over and pulled in the life-preserver as the Ark slowly came alongside,
and just in the nick of time, for the poor Ant was nearly dead.</p>

<p>"Give him to me," said Mrs. Noah. "A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> little Jamaica ginger and a warm
blanket will bring him 'round, I guess."</p>

<p>"Well, well!" exclaimed Capt. Noah, as the motherly form of Mrs. Noah
disappeared down the companionway. "This has been an exciting forenoon,"
and then he wiped his forehead with his red bordered handkerchief and
looked about him. "All you animals go below deck!" he commanded, "or
else we'll have somebody else overboard."</p>

<p>So Mrs. Elephant led Mr. Elephant, who was wet to the skin and shivering
with the cold, down to the hold, where she put him to bed with a hot
water bag at his feet and a woolen night cap on his head.</p>

<p>"Are you going to put this down in your log book?" asked Marjorie. "I
think it will make a very interesting story and I've heard from old
sailors that they always put down everything that happens in the log
book."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course I will," answered Capt. Noah. "Bring me the log book,
Japheth. You haven't done anything this morning. Suppose you jot it
down. I declare, I'm all tuckered out with excitement and worry."</p>

<p>"You'd better lie down and rest, father," said Mrs. Noah, coming up on
deck. "I have the Ant very comfortable now, and I feel sure he will
recover in a short time."</p>

<p>So Capt. Noah went below to rest, and the little Dove perched herself on
Marjorie's shoulder and watched Capt. Noah's son write in the log book.
And what do you suppose he wrote? Well, it was something like this, for
the little Dove told me afterwards:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The little red Ant fell into the sea,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But, oh, dear you, and oh, dear me!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And then the Elephant with a shout</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Jumped in and tried to pull him out.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But he wasn't saved by the Elephant;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">It was Mr. Jonah who saved the Ant.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<h2>FIRE! FIRE!</h2>
</div>

<p>"Fire! Fire! Fire!"</p>

<p>Marjorie awoke with a start. The Weathercock was again sounding the
warning, "Fire! Fire! Fire!"</p>

<p>"Where?" cried Marjorie, looking out of the porthole at the excited
Weathercock and then down to the deck, where at that moment Capt. Noah
and his sons appeared, each armed with a pail.</p>

<p>The fire evidently was at the forward end of the Ark, for Noah and his
crew ran in that direction.</p>

<p>It took Marjorie but a few minutes to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> dress, and just as she reached
the deck, Mr. Jonah appeared.</p>

<p>"This is a poor way to put out a fire," he said, as he tossed the water
from his pail down the hatchway, from which was rising a thick cloud of
smoke. "We need a hose and a pump."</p>

<p>"Hurry up, Jonah!" commanded Capt. Noah. "This fire is getting too much
headway to suit me. I'm afraid the animals will be roasted if we don't
put it out pretty soon!"</p>

<p>As he finished speaking the Elephant rushed on deck and, leaning over
the side of the Ark, filled his trunk with water, which he immediately
squirted over himself. And then Mrs. Elephant did the same.</p>

<p>"I was never so warm before," she remarked; "not even in India. If I had
stayed another minute below deck I would have been scarred for life!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time the deck was crowded. Some of the animals were nearly
frightened to death; some were choking with the smoke, while others were
filling the air with noises of all kinds. It was as if pandemonium were
let loose.</p>

<p>Those animals which could climb were soon scrambling to the roof of the
Ark, where they sat on or clung desperately to the ridgepole.</p>

<p>The deck grew hotter and hotter, and it was necessary for every one to
dance about in order to keep his feet from blistering.</p>

<p>"Holy sufferin' mackerel!" exclaimed Capt. Noah, now realizing the
seriousness of the situation. "Are we to be burned at sea?"</p>

<p>"Get the Elephants to squirt water down the hold," suggested Ham.</p>

<p>"Get busy," said Capt. Noah to the Elephants. "Your trunks are nearly as
good as hose. Why don't you help us?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you say, Ella?" said the Elephant. "If we don't we may have to
swim later."</p>

<p>Without answering, she went forward and commenced drawing up the salt
water in her trunk and then sending it in a swift stream down into the
hold. The fire, however, was gaining fast, and in spite of the efforts
of the Elephants and the crew the danger increased to an alarming
extent, and at last the flames leaped forth and crawled over the deck.</p>

<p>The animals howled and rushed to the stern of the Ark, which raised the
bow high in the air, and thus added to the danger.</p>

<p>"If it would only rain!" said Mrs. Noah, who sat on a coil of rope, her
sealskin coat on her arm and her jewel box in her hand.</p>

<p>"If it would only rain! This can't be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> the forty-first day, can it?
Time does go so fast."</p>

<p>Well, I guess something terrible would have happened if just then all of
a sudden the Weathercock hadn't seen the Whale, who had landed Mr. Jonah
aboard, some two or three chapters ago.</p>

<p>"There's the Whale!" shouted the Weathercock. "See him spout!"</p>

<p>"Run up a signal of distress!" commanded Capt. Noah. "He might save Mr.
Jonah for old times' sake!"</p>

<p>"If he'd only get up close and spout water over the Ark, he'd put out
the fire pretty quick," said Ham.</p>

<p>"Good idea," said Capt. Noah. "Ship ahoy!" yelled Mr. Jonah, waving his
red bandanna handkerchief in the air. "Ahoy! Ahoy!"</p>

<p>Then the Whale stopped spouting and made for the Ark.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's coming! He's coming!" shouted the Weathercock.</p>

<p>"Don't stop squirting water," said Capt. Noah to the Elephants.</p>

<p>"On with the pail brigade!" screamed Ham. And then the monkeys slid down
from the roof and grabbed hold of the pails and threw water down the
hold. But still the cruel flames crept nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" sighed Mrs. Noah. "I'm afraid my sealskin coat will get
singed, and after all the trouble I've had putting it up in camphor."</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, a tremendous stream of water fell upon the
Ark, soaking every one to the skin. And soon the deck was a river, and
the steam that came out of the hold almost suffocated everybody.</p>

<p>"Goodness me!" screamed Mrs. Noah. "We'll be swamped!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hold on, there," shouted Capt. Noah, leaning over the side of the Ark,
where the Whale lay like a fire patrol boat in action. "Hold on! Turn
off the hose, or you'll drown us!"</p>

<p>So the good-natured Whale shut off the water, while Capt. Noah added: "A
Turkish bath has nothing on this!"</p>

<p>"It was awfully kind of you to come to our rescue," said Mrs. Noah,
smiling sweetly at the Whale as she leaned over the railing.</p>

<p>"Well, if you hadn't come just when you did," said Capt. Noah, "I guess
we'd all have gone down to Davey Jones' locker."</p>

<p>"Don't mention it," said the Whale. "Glad to have been able to do you a
little favor. You see," he added in a low voice, "Mr. Jonah was never
satisfied when he was my guest. He was always complaining about the
dampness. So when you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> came along and I had a chance to put him aboard
the Ark I was tickled to death. In fact, I was so glad to get rid of my
passenger that I made up this little poem," and then the Whale began to
spout:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"It's not so very pleasant, when sailing on the sea,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To have a passenger aboard who's sulky as can be;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And that's the reason, after dark,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I landed him aboard the Ark."</span><br />
</p>

<p>And after that he swam away, and the Ark began once more to skim over
the dark blue sea. And by and by, after a while, Capt. Noah said:</p>

<p>"We'll have to make new bunks and berths for the animals, I guess, for
the fire has burned up everything."</p>

<p>And, oh, dear me! When he went below he saw that everything was burned
to a cinder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll have to land somewhere and make repairs," said Mr. Jonah.</p>

<p>"I guess we will," said Capt. Noah, and all the animals began to howl
and make dreadful noises, for they didn't want to go down in the smoky
hold, you see.</p>

<p>And just then all of a sudden the Weathercock called out:</p>

<p>"Land to starboard!"</p>

<p>And, sure enough, looming up in the dim distance was a mountainous shore
line.</p>

<h2>REPAIRS</h2>
</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ahoy, ahoy, Mount Ararat,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Now we know where we are at.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Run the Ark up high and dry,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Close against the bright blue sky.</span><br />
</p>


<p>"Not a bit of it!" shouted Capt. Noah, looking up at the Weathercock, "I
don't propose to take any chances running up that mountain side. Suppose
our motor gave out? We'd be in a nice fix. We'll run up on the shore and
heave to."</p>

<p>The Ark, obeying Capt. Noah's guiding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> hand, swept up on the beach and
came to a standstill some 200 feet from the water.</p>

<p>"We can cut all the timber we need for repairs now," said Japheth,
looking over toward a big forest that lay back from the beach. "The
animals, too, can have a nice frolic on the sand. It will do them good
after being cooped up on board ship for so long."</p>

<p>And in a short time the Ark was empty and all the animals were having a
fine time making castles in the sand and picking up pretty sea shells.</p>

<p>And after a while Capt. Noah got out his axe and saw, and calling to Mr.
Jonah, and his three boys, started off for the forest, and as soon as he
cut down a tree, Mr. Jonah and the three boys sawed it up into logs.</p>

<p>"I guess we have enough now," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> Capt. Noah. "Guess we'd better start
and split them into planks."</p>

<p>This was not such easy work, but after a while, they had quite a pile of
lumber on hand.</p>

<p>"If we only had a wagon to haul the logs to the Ark," said Capt. Noah,
wiping his forehead with his red bordered handkerchief.</p>

<p>And just then Marjorie came riding down the gang-plank in the little toy
automobile.</p>

<p>"I'll take them back to the Ark," she said, and after a while, not so
very long, they were all aboard.</p>

<p>Well, by this time it was pretty dark, and Capt. Noah felt uneasy about
the animals, so he stood up on the bow of the big boat and called out:</p>

<p>"All aboard for the night!"</p>

<p>"All aboard for the night!" he called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> out again, and then he turned to
little Marjorie and said, "I'd never forgive myself if anything should
happen to any one of my passengers."</p>

<p>But, oh dear me! When Capt. Noah, who had stood by the gang-plank and
checked off each animal as he came aboard, found that the little red
squirrel was missing, he was dreadfully worried.</p>

<p>"Goodness me!" he exclaimed, "if that squirrel has gone off into the
woods, how will we ever find him?"</p>

<p>"Well, there's no use in worrying," said Mrs. Noah, who just then came
up from below deck. "Come down and get a nice hot cup of tea. After
you've eaten something you'll know better what to do."</p>

<p>Well, after supper, everybody felt better, so Capt. Noah and his crew
came up on deck to look for the lost squirrel.</p>

<p>The moon was just coming up out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> the east, making a silver path
across the water right up to the Ark.</p>

<p>As Capt. Noah looked over the railing to the sand below he saw a little
figure walking directly in the silver moon path. It seemed to be
carrying something heavy; for it paused every now and then to rest.</p>

<p>"It's the little red squirrel," shouted Marjorie.</p>

<p>"So it is," said Capt. Noah.</p>

<p>"Helloa, there!" he shouted, "wait and I'll let down the gang-plank!"</p>

<p>"Whew, but I'm tired!" panted the red squirrel, as he crawled up on
deck. "This bag of nuts is as heavy as lead!"</p>

<p>And then he let the well-filled bag slip from his shoulders to the deck.</p>

<p>"Don't you ever stay out as late as this again, sir," said Capt. Noah,
pulling in the gang-plank and making it fast for the night. "If you do,
you won't get shore leave for a long time."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm glad you're back," whispered Marjorie, "for we were all dreadfully
worried about you," and this so pleased the little red squirrel that he
gave her a handful of chestnuts.</p>

<p>"Come along with me," said Capt. Noah, "I'm going below to see what the
boys are doing."</p>

<p>So Marjorie and the little squirrel followed the captain without a word,
for they saw that he was somewhat vexed.</p>

<p>Below deck all was in confusion, for the animals, after finishing their
supper, were trying to find places to sleep.</p>

<p>Although Mr. Jonah and the boys had made the place as clean as possible
since the fire, they had not, of course, been able in so short a time to
replace the bunks and pens in which the animals had slept.</p>

<p>Everybody was in everybody else's way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>The smaller animals were squeezed into corners by the larger ones, and
the Elephant complained that the red Ant kept treading on his toes.</p>

<p>"Order! Order!" shouted Capt. Noah.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, Jonah, and where are you, boys?" he called out,
peering into the darkness, for of course all the electric lights were
out and the hold was in total darkness.</p>

<p>"Here we are," answered Mr. Jonah. "We're doing the best we can," and he
came out of the darkness and rested his pitchfork on the floor while he
wiped the perspiration from his forehead.</p>

<p>"I was spreading out the straw for bedding. Ham is giving the pigs a
drink before they go to bed."</p>

<p>And just then the other two boys appeared. "What are you doing here?"
Japheth asked the muley cow, which stood by quietly chewing her cud.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>But the muley cow only said, "Moo-o-oo!"</p>

<p>"Well, you come along with me. All the cows are at the other end of the
Ark."</p>

<p>"Don't be impatient," said Capt. Noah, for the muley cow was a very
gentle creature and never tried to butt any one with her horns, because
she didn't have any, you know.</p>

<p>While all this was going on Marjorie and the little squirrel stood in
the doorway.</p>

<p>"Glad you weren't lost," said Shem, patting the squirrel on the back as
if he were a little pet dog. "The other squirrels said they wouldn't go
to bed until you were found."</p>

<p>"Where are they?" asked the little red squirrel. "I'm pretty sleepy and
would like to cuddle up for the night," and then he swung his bag of
nuts over his shoulder and followed Shem, but before he went he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
whispered to Marjorie that he'd give her some hickory nuts in the
morning.</p>

<p>After a while everything was made snug and tight for the night. Mr.
Jonah put away his pitchfork and the boys hung up the water pails. Then
a lighted lantern was hung at each end of the cabin, and the evening
chores were done, just the same as if they had been on a farm, you know.</p>

<p>And after that Marjorie went up on deck, where the weathercock was
sitting on the flagpole in the moonlight.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Oh, I love to be a sailor</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And sail the ocean blue,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And hear the Captain shout 'Ahoy!'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And order 'round the crew.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"And when the waves are rolling high</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The wind is blowing strong,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I sing my cock-a-doodle-do</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Just like a sailor song.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Oh, I'm a sailor rooster,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And my name is Shanghai Joe,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And I'll sail the sea from A to Z,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">I'm a sailor bird, Heave ho!"</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad you're so happy," said little Marjorie, and maybe she
felt just a little bit homesick, for she was far away from home. And
just then Mrs. Noah came on deck and said, "Come, Madge, it's time for
bed," and then she picked her up and carried her into her cabin and
tucked her in for the night as comfortable as you please. And in the
next chapter I'll tell you what happened in the morning.</p>

<h2>THE ICEBERG</h2>
</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Jingle bells! Jingle bells!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">It's getting cold as ice,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Put your furs and mittens on,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Wrap up warm and nice.</span><br />
</p>


<p>Marjorie awoke with a start. My, how cold it was! The porthole glass was
covered with a network of frosty lace, and the little Dove, who slept in
Marjorie's cabin, pulled her head out from under her wing and shivered.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" asked Marjorie, sitting up in bed and looking about
her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps she expected to see Jack Frost sitting in the rocking chair!</p>

<p>Quickly pulling on her slippers she ran to the porthole to ask her good
friend the Weathercock the reason for this sudden drop in the
temperature.</p>

<p>She found him, as usual, perched on the flagpole. His comb was very red,
as if Jack Frost had given it a nip, and now and then he raised one leg
to his breast to warm his toes in the fluffy feathers.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said Marjorie. "Isn't it freezing?"</p>

<p>"Do you wonder?" answered the Weathercock, pointing to a large iceberg
close at hand.</p>

<p>She turned to look and, sure enough, just a few feet away was a great
mountain of ice.</p>

<p>"We're aground on an iceberg," went on the Weathercock. "We ran into an
ice floe last night and the Ark slipped upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> the ledge of the iceberg
and grounded."</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious!" cried Marjorie. "What are we ever going to do?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," answered the Weathercock. "I'll have to get
some woolen socks and a pair of felt shoes or my toes will be
frostbitten!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mrs. Noah will knit you a pair," said Marjorie. "I'm going down
to breakfast now and I'll speak to her about it."</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied the Weathercock. "And tell her I wouldn't mind
having a worsted muffler, too."</p>

<p>Down below matters were even worse, for the fresh water had frozen
during the night, so that it was impossible to give the animals a drink.</p>

<p>Mrs. Noah had been forced to melt a piece of ice in a pan over the fire
in order to have water with which to make the coffee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whew!" exclaimed Capt. Noah, coming in from deck and closing the door
as quickly as possible. "My hands are almost frozen. This is as bad as a
trip to the North Pole. Perhaps worse, for we are totally unprepared for
this kind of weather."</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Jonah and the boys came in, rubbing their hands and
stamping their feet to keep warm.</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas!" laughed Ham, "the skating's fine out on the ice
floe!"</p>

<p>"How jolly!" cried Marjorie. "Let's go skating after breakfast!"</p>

<p>"No, sir-e-e," said Capt. Noah. "The boys must help me float the Ark.
One of the rubber-tired wheels is crushed and it will take a lot of hard
work to get her off."</p>

<p>"We'd better set about it as soon as possible," said Mr. Jonah, after
Capt. Noah had made an inspection. "Some of the animals are nearly
perishing with the cold.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> The monkeys are rolled up so tight you'd think
they were fur balls. Only the polar bears seem to enjoy life, and they
are just crazy to take a run on the ice."</p>

<p>"Let them wait," said Capt. Noah; "we have more serious things to attend
to than pleasure for the moment."</p>

<p>"Well, come and get a good hot breakfast first," said Mrs. Noah,
bringing in the steaming coffee pot and a plate of hot corn muffins.
"After breakfast you'll all feel differently."</p>

<p>This was, indeed, good advice, and when breakfast was over Capt. Noah
said, "Get the crowbar and the wooden rollers, Japheth. We'll see if we
can't start the old Ark moving. Maybe she's stuck too deep in the ice,
but we'll try, at any rate."</p>

<p>"Here, my little girl," said kind Mrs. Noah to Marjorie, "put on this
muffler if you're going out. It's pretty cold."</p>

<p>So Marjorie tied the warm muffler<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> around her neck and stepped out on
deck.</p>

<p>A beautiful sight met her eyes. Towering high above was a mountain of
glittering ice, while as far as the eye could reach was a field of ice
and snow.</p>

<p>Under the rays of the morning sun parts of the great berg glittered like
a rainbow.</p>

<p>It was so cold that Marjorie had to jump up and down to keep her toes
from freezing.</p>

<p>Down on the ice, close to the Ark, Capt. Noah and his crew were busily
at work. One of the auto wheels had sunk deep into the ice and acted
like an anchor. The other wheels also were embedded in the ice so that
the Ark was held as if in a vise.</p>

<p>"Guess we'll have to give it up," exclaimed Capt. Noah after an hour's
hard work, during which time the Ark had not moved an inch.</p>

<p>"We'd better make up our minds to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> winter here until the iceberg floats
into a warmer climate and either melts or breaks apart."</p>

<p>"That's cheerful," said Mr. Jonah. "I've nothing but summer flannels and
a mackintosh with me."</p>

<p>"What about some of the poor animals who are used to the Torrid Zone?"
replied Capt. Noah, shouldering the crowbar and climbing up the rope
ladder to the deck.</p>

<p>Mr. Jonah did not reply, but turned up his coat collar and stamped upon
his feet to warm them.</p>

<p>"The hairless Mexican dog will surely die if we don't do something for
him," said Ham. "I think I'll ask mother if she won't let him stay in
the kitchen."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Noah did not seem very pleased over the suggestion.</p>

<p>"Gracious me!" she said. "Shem already has two parrots, a marmoset and a
little green snake in the kitchen. I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> suppose one more animal
would make much difference, if it will only keep from under my feet. I
nearly stepped on one of the snakes this morning, and the kitchen is
none too large, anyway."</p>

<p>"Don't you boys worry your mother any more," said Capt. Noah sternly.
"The animals have got to make the best of it. Any one who travels by sea
undergoes some risk and I'm sure I'm as careful a captain as a man could
be. It's lucky we didn't go down to the bottom of the sea when we struck
the berg, instead of running up on it safely."</p>

<p>After dinner Capt. Noah and Mr. Jonah held a consultation as to what was
the best thing to do under the circumstances.</p>

<p>"Of course, some of the animals, like the polar bears and the seals,
will enjoy a vacation on the ice. The penguins, too, will be glad to
have a little change. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> can let them out and the rest of the Arctic
passengers. But how to keep the other animals warm, puzzles me. We
haven't coal enough to keep the furnaces going for very long."</p>

<p>Mr. Jonah stroked his chin reflectively. "We might dig a channel from
the Ark to the edge of the berg and then float the Ark," he said, after
a pause.</p>

<p>"That's a pretty good scheme," said Capt. Noah. "We'll get to work at
once. Here, you boys, get the pickaxes and come with me."</p>

<p>By evening the canal was finished. "Now, when the tide rises," said
Capt. Noah, resting on the handle of his pickax, "perhaps the old tub
will float."</p>

<p>It was now quite dark, so all hands returned to the Ark.</p>

<p>The animals which had been allowed to play on the ice had all returned
except the two polar bears, who begged Capt. Noah<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> to let them stay out
all night, as they wished to see the Northern Lights from the top of the
iceberg.</p>

<p>It was a very tired family that gathered around the supper table that
evening. But after the meal was over the Weathercock began to sing:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"It's time for bed, and all the Ark</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Should soon be snoring in the dark,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The elephant and kangaroo,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The lion and the curled horn gnu,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Have gone to bed, and so should you,</span><br />

<h2>A THRILLING RESCUE</h2>
</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We're off! we're off! we're off again</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To sail upon the rolling main.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The ice no longer holds us fast,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We're sailing safe and free at last!</span><br />
</p>

<p>This is what the Weathercock sang loud and clear the next morning.</p>

<p>It woke up Marjorie with a start, and running to the porthole she saw
that they were once more upon the ocean blue.</p>

<p>"How did it happen?" she asked, turning to her faithful friend on the
flagpole, who was still crowing and flapping his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> wings at a great rate.
"How did it all happen?"</p>

<p>"While you were asleep, my dear little Madge," answered the Weathercock.</p>

<p>"I didn't ask you when, I asked you how," laughed Marjorie, for she was
delighted, you see, to be once more sailing over the great big ocean.</p>

<p>"You'd better not ask me any more questions," said the Weathercock
quickly. "You just better hurry up and dress and ask Capt. Noah what he
is going to do about the castaways."</p>

<p>"The what?" gasped Marjorie.</p>

<p>"The castaways. The two polar bears who are still on the iceberg."</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious!" she cried. "I'll hurry and get on my boots. I must
tell Capt. Noah at once."</p>

<p>In a few minutes she was running down to the lower cabin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Capt. Noah! Capt. Noah!" she shouted. "Capt. Noah, the polar bears are
left on the iceberg!"</p>

<p>The captain, who had overslept himself, put his head out of his cabin
door.</p>

<p>"What is all the excitement about?" he asked sleepily.</p>

<p>"The bears are left on the iceberg!" shouted Marjorie again.</p>

<p>"Well, that's all right. I told them they could stay out all night. They
will come aboard for breakfast, no doubt!"</p>

<p>"They can't! They can't!" cried Marjorie in great excitement. "The Ark
is afloat again and we are sailing away."</p>

<p>"Blubber and rubber!" exclaimed the captain, now even more excited than
the little girl.</p>

<p>"Mother!" he cried, "the Ark's afloat and two of our passengers are
still ashore!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Noah opened her eyes.</p>

<p>"What did you say, my dear?" she asked, sleepily.</p>

<p>The captain by this time had pulled on his sailor suit and, closing the
cabin door with a bang, rushed out on deck, with Marjorie close at his
heels.</p>

<p>In the distance the iceberg could be seen indistinctly through the
morning mist.</p>

<p>"Hard-a-port!" shouted Capt. Noah.</p>

<p>Mr. Jonah, who was at the wheel, woke up with a start. He was so tired
with cutting the ice the day before that he had fallen sound asleep at
his post.</p>

<p>"You landlubber," cried Capt. Noah. "What do you mean by falling
asleep?"</p>

<p>"This is my first experience before the mast," apologized poor Jonah.
"I've always been a passenger. Please don't get provoked."</p>

<p>"Provoked!" yelled Capt. Noah. "Provoked!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> I feel like throwing you
overboard!"</p>

<p>"Steer for the iceberg!"</p>

<p>"I won't throw you overboard until later!"</p>

<p>Mr. Jonah heaved a sigh of relief, for at first I guess he thought he'd
have to go back to the Whale without having the chance of Capt. Noah
cooling off.</p>

<p>Marjorie stood close to the rail, straining her eyes for a glimpse of
the polar bears.</p>

<p>The three Noah boys now came on deck, and Ham handed the spyglass to his
father.</p>

<p>"I see them! I see them!" cried Capt. Noah. "One of them is waving a
flag!"</p>

<p>"Let me look," said Marjorie, who was dreadfully worried about them.</p>

<p>Yes, there they were. On the top of the berg she could dimly see two
figures and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> white object waving back and forth. The sea was getting
rough and the Ark rolled about in a most uncomfortable manner.</p>

<p>The Weathercock clung tightly to his post, however, and flapped his
wings now and then.</p>

<p>"Look out!" he cautioned as the Ark neared the berg. "Be careful or
you'll stave a hole in the Ark!"</p>

<p>"Hurry up!" shouted the polar bears. "We're nearly starved. We want our
breakfast."</p>

<p>"Want your breakfast!" muttered Capt. Noah under his breath. "You'll be
wanting something more than breakfast if we don't find a way to get you
aboard!"</p>

<p>"Let them swim!" suggested Ham.</p>

<p>"Run up close and let them jump!" advised Shem.</p>

<p>"Let them fly!" chuckled Japheth, unsympathetically, who was somewhat
tired of feeding the animals and felt that two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> less would not be such
an awful thing after all.</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort," cried Capt. Noah. "I am responsible for the safety
of every passenger. I will take no such chances."</p>

<p>"What are we going to do, then?" asked Mr. Jonah, looking over the side
of the Ark to make sure that it was not getting too close to the
dangerous berg, which jutted out in ragged points beneath the water.</p>

<p>"Launch the life-boat!" commanded Capt. Noah. "Who will volunteer?"</p>

<p>"I will!" cried Ham, and in less time than I can take to tell it, Ham
and his trained monkeys lowered the boat and jumped in.</p>

<p>"Shove off!" commanded Cockswain Ham, and with a strong pull and a loud
"Yo-ho!" the little boat shot away.</p>

<p>Ham held firmly to the tiller and kept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> the bow pointed toward the big
rollers, while the monkeys handled the oars.</p>

<p>"Pull for the shore, sailor, pull for the shore," sang the Weathercock.</p>

<p>The bears, who had slid down the iceberg close to the water's edge,
stood anxiously waiting.</p>

<p>"Careful, now!" cried Ham. "Pull on your starboard oar!"</p>

<p>The boat grazed the iceberg. "Jump!" shouted Ham. "Quick!"</p>

<p>And then one of the bears gave a spring and landed in the boat. His
mate, however, slipped, and a big wave at that moment whirled the boat
away from the ice, and with a big splash he landed in the water.</p>

<p>"Throw him a life-preserver!" shouted Capt. Noah.</p>

<p>"Throw him a life line!" yelled Shem.</p>

<p>"Throw him the anchor!" growled Japheth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> who never had liked the Polar
Bears, I guess.</p>

<p>But Cockswain Ham was not the least bit rattled. He steered the boat
toward the frightened bear and told him to catch hold.</p>

<p>"Now pull for all you're worth!" shouted Ham to the monkeys, "and we'll
tow Brother Bear."</p>

<p>But, oh, dear me! The great waves kept washing over the little boat, and
the two monkeys had a hard time rowing with that great heavy bear
dragging on the stern.</p>

<p>"They'll be swamped!" screamed Mrs. Noah, as a tremendous great wave
dashed over the little life-boat.</p>

<p>"Bail, bail, you lubber!" shouted Ham. "We'll all be in Davy Jones's
locker if you don't!"</p>

<p>Well, pretty soon they came alongside the Ark, and Capt. Noah let down a
rope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> ladder, up which the two bears managed to scramble after a hard
struggle.</p>

<p>And after that Cockswain Ham and his gallant crew came aboard, and the
life-boat was hoisted up on deck.</p>

<p>Motherly Mrs. Noah at once put the two bears to bed after a hot mustard
bath and a drink of Jamaica ginger.</p>

<p>"Well, this beats the old days all holler!" exclaimed Capt. Noah. "We
never had such accidents on my first voyage. It just rained and rained
for forty days and forty nights."</p>

<p>"That's the truth, my dear," agreed Mrs. Noah. "I remember it very well.
Ham was just a baby, and the other two boys were little fellows. It was
hard work finding something new for them to do each day. Rainy days on
board ship&mdash;well, I never want to go through with it again."</p>

<p>"I should think your boys would think you're just lovely," said little
Marjorie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I guess we do," said Ham, kissing his mother. "You know we do,
mother dear."</p>

<p>"Of course I do," she replied, giving him a hug.</p>

<p>"Go and kiss your mother," said Capt. Noah to Shem and Japheth, "or she
won't give you any breakfast."</p>

<p>And then they both ran over to her and kissed her, glad of an excuse to
show their real feelings.</p>

<p>"Now, come and get something nice and hot for breakfast," said Mrs.
Noah, "for if we don't eat breakfast pretty soon, we'll have to call it
lunch."</p>

<p>And in the next chapter you shall hear of a dreadful collision, but
don't worry, for I shan't let anything happen to little Marjorie and the
kind Noah family.</p>

<h2>A LEAK</h2>
</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Look out! Look out! A boat in sight;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Turn quickly to the left or right;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You'll have a smash-up, sure as fate&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Alas! my warning came too late!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>sang the Weathercock.</p>

<p>And, oh, dear me! He was right! Crash! Bang! The Noah's Ark shivered
from bow to stern, and all the animals were thrown off their feet.</p>

<p>Little Marjorie awoke with a start. It was just daylight, and far off in
the east the rising sun was tinging the sky pink and gold.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>She hurriedly put on her clothes and ran out on deck, where she met
Capt. Noah and his sons.</p>

<p>"Whales and porpoises!" exclaimed Capt. Noah. "Mr. Jonah has been asleep
at the switch again, I'll bet!"</p>

<p>And then he ran forward and looked over the bow of the Ark.</p>

<p>Only a few yards off was the charred hull of a vessel, riding low in the
water.</p>

<p>Quickly examining his own ship, Capt. Noah discovered a hole on the
starboard side.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, the animals came rushing up on deck.</p>

<p>"The Ark is filling with water," cried Mrs. Elephant, "and my slippers
are all soaking wet. If I had remained below another minute they would
have been ruined!"</p>

<p>She had hardly finished when all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> rats and mice scrambled up the
companionway.</p>

<p>"A bad sign!" said Capt. Noah. "It shows the Ark is sinking!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Noah gave a scream. She had hastily thrown a kimono over her
nightdress at the first warning and had hurried on deck.</p>

<p>"Don't worry," said little Marjorie bravely. "Capt. Noah will stop the
leak."</p>

<p>"I hope so," he said. Then, turning to the passengers, he asked: "Who
will volunteer to go with me below deck?"</p>

<p>"I will!" shouted Ham.</p>

<p>"And so will I!" said the Elephant.</p>

<p>"Come along, then," said Capt. Noah.</p>

<p>"Throw me down the tarpaulin and some planks," he called up a few
minutes later.</p>

<p>But, oh dear me! The water had gained such headway that the tarpaulin
was of no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> use at all, and I don't know what would have happened if the
Elephant hadn't sat down squarely on the hole, blocking it up so that
not a single drop of water leaked in.</p>

<p>"Bully for you!" cried Capt. Noah. "That's the best stunt I've seen
yet!"</p>

<p>"It's not very comfortable," said the Elephant, with a shiver. "My, but
the water's chilly!"</p>

<p>"Start the pumps!" commanded Capt. Noah, rushing to the foot of the
companionway. "Set some of the animals to work!"</p>

<p>Well, after a while the Ark was pumped dry, and everybody heaved a sigh
of relief.</p>

<p>"How long do you expect me to be a water plug?" asked the Elephant. "You
don't expect me to sit here for the rest of the voyage?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what we'll do if you get up," answered Capt. Noah.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Neither do I," said the Elephant.</p>

<p>"Let's call Mr. Jonah," said Capt. Noah.</p>

<p>"What's the use?" said the Elephant. "What good will he do? If he hadn't
been asleep at the tiller we never would have had the accident."</p>

<p>"We might punish him for neglect of duty," said Capt. Noah. "We'll plug
the hole up with him. He can sit on the opening for a punishment."</p>

<p>"Great idea!" chuckled the Elephant. "Bring him down."</p>

<p>So Capt. Noah hastened on deck to look for poor Mr. Jonah. And pretty
soon he came back with Mr. Jonah, who of course didn't know what they
were going to do with him.</p>

<p>"What do you want me for?" he asked. "It's pretty damp down here."</p>

<p>"Hello!" said the Elephant. "Excuse my not rising!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly," said Mr. Jonah, "but you don't look very comfortable."</p>

<p>And then, quick as a wink, the Elephant reached out his trunk and
grabbed poor Mr. Jonah.</p>

<p>"Help! Murder!" yelled Jonah, nearly strangled by the water, which
rushed into the Ark as the Elephant got up.</p>

<p>"Keep quiet!" commanded Capt. Noah, and then the Elephant pushed poor
Mr. Jonah into the hole.</p>

<p>"It's all your fault that we had this accident. Now you can stop up the
leak!"</p>

<p>Mr. Jonah was too frightened to speak. Finally, when he partly recovered
from his fright he said:</p>

<p>"But what am I to do?"</p>

<p>"Don't do a thing," said Capt. Noah, pushing him down as he started to
get up. "You just sit there and be a hero!"</p>

<p>"I won't!" cried Mr. Jonah.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then we'll all drown, and you, too!" said Capt. Noah.</p>

<p>And just then the Weathercock shouted out loud and clear:</p>

<p>"Land ahead! Land ahead!"</p>

<p>And in a few short seconds the Ark rolled upon a sandy beach and came to
a standstill.</p>

<p>"Throw out the anchor!" commanded Capt. Noah. "We won't take any chances
this time."</p>

<p>And pretty soon all the animals were playing on the sand, while Mrs.
Noah, with Marjorie and the boys, made a fire under some palm trees.</p>

<p>Suddenly Capt. Noah remembered Mr. Jonah. "Thunder and lightning!" he
exclaimed, and at once descended into the hold, where he found poor Mr.
Jonah still sitting on the hole in the Ark.</p>

<p>"Arise, noble man!" said Capt. Noah, bursting into laughter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank goodness," said Jonah. "I feel as stiff as a glass bottle
stopper."</p>

<p>And in the next chapter you shall hear of a wonderful picnic which they
all had on this little green island in the middle of the big blue
ocean.</p>

<h2>THE PICNIC</h2>
</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Don't leave me alone on the Ark, Marjie, dear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For I shall be lonely I very much fear.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Now, how would you like to be left alone</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">High up on a perch where the wild breezes moan?"</span><br />
</p>

<p>"The Weathercock wants to come with us," said Marjorie.</p>

<p>"Then why doesn't he?" said Capt. Noah, who was busily engaged in making
the anchor line fast.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll tell him to come with us."</p>

<p>And she ran up the gang-plank and called to the lonely Weathercock:</p>

<p>"Why don't you fly down? We'd like to have you come ashore with us."</p>

<p>"That's all I wanted to know," said the faithful bird. "Look out! Here
she goes!"</p>

<p>And with a great flutter and flapping of his gilt wings he landed on the
sand.</p>

<p>And after that he and Marjorie went over to the clump of palm trees
where Mrs. Noah and the boys were resting.</p>

<p>"This would be a fine spot for a picnic," she said. "Did you ever go to
one?"</p>

<p>"No, I've never been to one, although I once went to a fair with
father," said Marjorie.</p>

<p>"Well, while the boys are busy with Capt. Noah mending the Ark, we'll
get a fire started and have our lunch out here beneath the trees."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>It didn't take long to get the fire started, for Mrs. Noah wished to
surprise the Captain when he came back, and pretty soon the kettle was
singing away:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Hurray for the jolly picnic</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And the crew of the red Noah's Ark.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I'll whistle and sing like a bird in the spring,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">While the red flames gleam and spark."</span><br />
</p>

<p>"There are some nice clams on the beach," said Mrs. Noah.</p>

<p>So the Weathercock took a basket and went down to the water's edge and
brought back enough for everybody.</p>

<p>And I guess Mrs. Noah had been to many a clam bake, for she knew just
how to roast them in a pile of seaweed and red hot stones.</p>

<p>Well, pretty soon Capt. Noah with Mr. Jonah and the three boys came out
of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> Ark and sat down beneath the palm trees, and then all the
animals sat around in a ring, for this was the first picnic they had
ever been to.</p>

<p>"I'm as hungry as a bear," said little Marjorie, and then the Elephant
began to laugh, but the bear only smiled and spread his bread with
honey.</p>

<p>Of course, some of the animals didn't eat any of Mrs. Noah's lunch. The
giraffe stood near by and ate the tender leaves off the tops of the
trees and the monkeys ate cocoanuts, and the ducks and geese kept close
to the water and snapped up little fishes and snails. But everybody had
a wonderful time.</p>

<p>"I think, Mother," said Capt. Noah, wiping the crumbs from the
tablecloth, and holding them out to a little brown thrush who had sat on
his shoulder during the meal, "we had better spend the night ashore.
I'll bring the big tent from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> Ark and set it up under the trees. I'm
going to do a little painting inside the Ark this afternoon."</p>

<p>"That's a very good idea," said Mrs. Noah.</p>

<p>When the tent was set up and the ropes securely fastened to the pegs
which had been driven into the ground, Mrs. Noah and Marjorie busied
themselves fixing it up inside in order to make it comfortable for the
night.</p>

<p>And when evening came, a bright fire was lighted and after supper,
everybody sat around and talked. Ham popped corn and Marjorie roasted
apples.</p>

<p>"Nine o'clock," said Capt. Noah, "time for bed. We must be up early in
the morning."</p>

<p>"It was the loveliest picnic I ever had," said Marjorie, as she kissed
Mrs. Noah good night.</p>

<h2>THE STORM</h2>
</div>

<p>By noon the next day Capt. Noah reported that the paint was dry and the
Ark ready to set sail.</p>

<p>"We must get the animals together," he said, looking anxiously about. "I
can't imagine where they have all gone to."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll have everything packed and ready to put aboard by the time
you round up your passengers," laughed Mrs. Noah who never seemed to
worry about anything, and Marjorie thought she was the nicest person she
had ever met.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, boys," commanded Capt. Noah, "let's start the hunt. I hope the
island isn't large, for I don't fancy walking many miles in this hot
climate."</p>

<p>So they all started off, Mr. Jonah and the three Noah boys following
Capt. Noah, and after walking for some time they came to the top of a
hill, from which they had a good view of the island. And not very far
away were all the animals, enjoying themselves to their hearts' content.</p>

<p>Capt. Noah took his bugle and blew a long blast, and at once all the
animals looked around.</p>

<p>Then he blew again, and after that the animals formed in line with the
Elephant at their head and marched toward them.</p>

<p>When they reached the Ark the gang-plank was lowered and they all
marched aboard.</p>

<p>Everything below decks was in apple-pie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> order and the animals all
seemed glad to be once more back in the Ark.</p>

<p>"All's well that ends well," said Capt. Noah, turning to Mr. Jonah. "My
duty is to land these animals safely after the rain is over. But it
looks to me as if it were going to commence again."</p>

<p>"There's a big black cloud in the west," shouted the Weathercock, who
had flown up to his perch on the flagpole and was keeping a sharp
lookout.</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess we're going to have some nasty weather," said Capt. Noah.
"Let us hurry and get the Ark afloat."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the great boat was in motion, and after a short run
down to the water, it once more rode the waves.</p>

<p>"You'd better come down to the cabin," Capt. Noah called out to the
Weathercock as a flash of lightning passed across the sky. "We're going
to have a storm, and you may be blown off your perch."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>So the Weathercock came down and perched on his shoulder, and then he
began to sing:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Oh, the animals came into the Ark,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The little dog with a bow-wow bark,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The lion gave a kingly roar,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the monkey shook the rat by the paw,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the muley cow said moo-o-o,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the rooster sang his cockle-do."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Well, it didn't take long for Capt. Noah and his crew to make everything
snug and tight.</p>

<p>But, oh dear me! How the thunder roared and the lightning flashed, but
in spite of all this, Marjorie grew so sleepy that pretty soon she went
up to her little cabin with the dove on her shoulder, and crept into
bed.</p>

<p>And then something strange happened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> The Weathercock, although he had
hopped into the cabin to escape the storm, went out on deck every now
and then to look about him, so as to report to Capt. Noah the
whereabouts of the Ark.</p>

<p>He didn't seem to mind the storm, for a weathercock is used to all sorts
of weather and knows just from what quarter the wind is blowing, you
know.</p>

<p>About midnight, after coming in from deck, he hopped up to little
Marjorie's cabin and knocked on the door. But she was so fast asleep she
didn't hear him, and if it hadn't been for the dove, who was a very
light sleeper, I don't believe the Weathercock would ever have been able
to tell Marjorie this strange thing that had happened.</p>

<p>But just as soon as the little dove heard the knocking, she flew down
from her cage and opened the door. And after the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> Weathercock had
whispered to her she went over to where Marjorie lay sound asleep in her
berth.</p>

<p>And just then the Ark grated on something and came to a standstill, but
so gradually did the great boat stop that Capt. Noah, who was also sound
asleep, did not even move in his berth.</p>

<p>"Wake little Marjorie," whispered the Weathercock, and then the little
white bird leaned over the pillow, and sang in a low voice:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Wake up, wake up, Marjorie dear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Come to the window,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Your home is quite near.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">See, we are landed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Upon your own roof,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Just outside your bedroom.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Come, here is the proof&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I'll lift up the curtain;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">There's your little bed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With the cosy white pillow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And cover of red."</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is it? Where am I?" asked Marjorie, opening her eyes.</p>

<p>"Come," said the Weathercock, "follow me."</p>

<p>Dreamily she got up and followed him to the window. Opposite was her own
little bedroom window.</p>

<p>"Step over carefully," whispered the Weathercock, while the Dove took
her by the hand. Marjorie stepped across the open space and entered her
bedroom. Then she walked over to her own little bed and crept inside.</p>

<p>"Go to sleep!" whispered the Weathercock.</p>

<p>"See you in the morning," cooed the Dove, and with a gentle flutter they
disappeared through the window. Indistinctly Marjorie heard the Ark cast
away from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> the windowsill. And the voice of Capt. Noah came faintly to
her ears:</p>

<p>"Careful, now! We must slip in through the nursery window without waking
the household."</p>

<p>As the "Noah's Ark" slowly drifted in through the nursery window,
Captain Noah ran forward with a hawser, ready to make fast to the book
case near the big table.</p>

<p>"Well! Well!" he exclaimed. "It is nice to be home again!"</p>

<p>"It certainly is!" said Mrs. Noah, as she and the three boys came out on
deck. "It is wonderful that the water has done no damage to Marjorie's
pretty nursery."</p>

<p>"See how fast it is running away!" exclaimed Ham. "Lucky we sailed home
tonight!"</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Noah looked at the book case. "Gee Hossephat!" he
exclaimed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> "See that book&mdash;'The Cruise of the Noah's Ark'&mdash;why there is
my picture on the cover!"</p>

<p>"Look! Look!" shouted Japheth. "There are more books in the series of
'Little Journeys to Happyland!'"</p>

<p>"So there are," laughed Mrs. Noah. "I would like to read 'The Iceberg
Express.' That sounds interesting."</p>

<p>"I think 'A Little Journey to Happyland in the Magic Soap Bubble' would
be some trip!" exclaimed Shem.</p>

<p>"Time for bed," suddenly exclaimed Captain Noah. "I am going to turn out
all the lights on the 'Noah's Ark.' No time tonight for you to read
these other books in this series," and with these words he turned out
the red light on the port side of the Ark and the green light on the
starboard side and with a sigh of relief added, "Thank goodness! All
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> animals are well and Marjorie upstairs asleep in her little bed and
the old 'Noah's Ark' back safe in the nursery."</p>

<p>As Captain Noah ceased speaking, the Weathercock fluttered off the Ark
and over to the nursery window. Pausing a moment on the sill, he turned
for one last look, and then flew straight away for Uncle Spencer's barn.</p>

<p>"Home again!" he chuckled.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Who'd have thought I'd ever be</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A pilot on the deep blue sea."</span><br />

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
